The official theme repo for Simple. Fork this to use it as a boilerplate.

# Getting Started

This theme uses LESS for CSS precompiling, and it uses Gulp for compiling the LESS into CSS, and also for concatenating and minifying JavaScript files.

Note: You do not need LESS and Gulp to use this theme, you can just edit the CSS directly if you like. LESS and Gulp are for advanced users.

1) Install Node Modules

Run the following command in Terminal to install Gulp for LESS preprocessing.

npm install
2) Run Gulp

Run gulp to make sure all CSS and JavaScript files are the latest versions.

gulp
